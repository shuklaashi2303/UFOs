# UFOs

# Overview:

We helped Dana to create the webpage using javascript, css and HTML to provide in depth analysis of UFO sightings by using multiple filter using at same time.  



# Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis is to cover the different fields of search including date, city, state, shape and country for the year of 2010. Dana needed the table search tab as well as all the details related to it on same page. See below images for further explanation:

# Summary:

The one drawback is that data is too large to search it manually. Our collection is large enough that creates trouble locating specific areas. To overcome this issue we could provide the automatic table search and other is multiple search options using d3, HTML, CSS and js.
